 * knight's mane, with a neutral cast. city was softer, warehouse nearly flat,
 * and dawn threw a blue-violet tint that fought the warm palette.
 *
 * Served from public/ rather than drei's `preset` prop on purpose: `preset`
 * pulls the HDR from raw.githack.com at runtime, which would put a
 * third-party CDN on the critical path of every page load in production.

 * and the board lost its checker read entirely. Sweeping intensity against
 * sampled tile pixels gave:

 * - The Environment map. MeshStandardMaterial with no environment has nothing
 *   to reflect, which is what made the pieces read as plaster. This is what
 *   puts specular highlights on the lacquer facets.
 * - The rim light. The lacquer is nearly black with flatShading, so without a
 *   contrasting light raking across it from behind, the kabuto facets and the
 *   knight's muzzle collapse into a flat silhouette.
 *
 * Fix black-piece legibility here, never by lightening the material.
