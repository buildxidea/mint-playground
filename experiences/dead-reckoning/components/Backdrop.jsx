 * The painting is a single 2560x1429 frame, NOT a seamless 360 panorama, so it
 * is mapped onto a cylinder *segment* and the camera's azimuth is clamped to a
 * sector where the open ends stay off screen. A narrow sector with a good frame
 * beats a full orbit with a visible seam.
 *
 * Geometry is derived, not eyeballed — same method as Mountains.jsx. With the
 * camera at [3.5, 7, -8.5] (fov 42) looking at the origin, the view direction
 * is pitched 37.3 degrees down, so the top of the frame is already 16.3 degrees
 * *below* horizontal and the board's far edge sits at -28.3 degrees. The whole
 * background is that ~12-degree band in between. Placing the painting's skyline
 * at -19 degrees puts it inside that band with a strip of sky above it.
 *
 * At radius R the eye-to-wall distance is ~R + 9.2, so:
 *   y_skyline = 7 - (R + 9.2) * tan(19deg)
 * and the skyline sits 20% down the image (measured off the luminance profile:
 * rows 0-10% are flat sky at ~227, the far ridges break in around 20%), so
 *   TOP_Y = y_skyline + 0.20 * HEIGHT
 *
 * Крок 18: no longer one hardcoded aspect ratio. Each theme now brings its
 * own image at its own native size (Mist 2560x1429, Ocean 1584x672, Snow
 * 1376x768 — Mint doesn't guarantee a common aspect across separate
 * generations), so ImageBackdropSegment derives it from the loaded
 * texture's own `image.width`/`image.height` instead of a module constant.

 * Крок 9.5, Section B: the painting only ever covered ~200 of 360 degrees

 * nothing painted in it. Azimuth has been unclamped since SkyDome shipped
 * (see "Camera and environment" in CLAUDE.md), so a full orbit was always
 * reachable — it just wasn't always dressed.
 *
 * BACKDROP_SEGMENTS is the fix: one entry per painted cylinder segment, each
 * independently placed by its own `azimuth` (segment centre) and `arcDeg`,
 * each fading into SkyDome at its own edges through the same edge-alpha
 * mechanism the original single segment already had (getBackdropEdgeAlphaMap
 * in proceduralTextures.js). Segments are ordinary alpha-blended transparent
 * meshes, so where two overlap it's just two fading edges compositing on top
 * of each other — not a seam to solve for, per the brief.
 *
 * Two segments today, both the *same* painting (the active theme's own
 * `backdrop.image`) — one at its natural azimuth, one rotated 180 degrees
 * and mirrored the other way — are the stand-in every theme uses while each
 * only has one Mint frame. It already fully closes the circle: each arc is
 * 200 degrees (+/-100 from its own centre), the two centres are 180 degrees
 * apart, so segment A's far edge (its centre +100) lands 20 degrees past
 * segment B's near edge (its centre -100) — every azimuth falls inside at
 * least one of the two, with two ~20-degree bands (near each pair of edges)
 * inside both. Heavy fog and the edge fades on both sides make the repeated,
 * mirrored painting hard to spot in practice.
 *
 * The real fix is generating two more Mint frames of the same valley per
 * theme and moving ARC_DEG-per-segment toward the brief's ~140 degrees each
 * with the same overlap logic — nothing about this array's *shape* needs to
 * change for that, only its contents (see the TODO comment on the second
 * entry below).
 *
 * Крок 19: this is a function now, not a frozen array — `src` depends on
 * which theme is active, and that's live now instead of fixed at module
 * load. Called from inside Backdrop() and memoized on `themeKey`.
