 * of it — mounted inside <Canvas> only while GameCanvas's `phase` is
 * 'intro' or 'transitioning', and it drives `camera.position`/`lookAt`
 * directly every frame, the same imperative pattern CameraRig already uses
 * (never through React state — a per-frame setState would be one re-render
 * per frame for 14 seconds straight).
 *
 * It does NOT reuse OrbitControls for any of this: the three shots are
 * scripted cuts, not something a spherical orbit around one target could
 * produce (frame 2 orbits *around a piece*, not the board centre). Real
 * OrbitControls is only mounted once phase reaches 'playing' — see
