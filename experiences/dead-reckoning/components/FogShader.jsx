 * ARCHITECTURE, and the two previous ones it replaced.
 *
 * Крок 10 Section B: FOG_LAYERS (5) real planes at five heights, each its own
 * ShaderMaterial computing three from-scratch noise functions (one fbm + two
 * ridged, five octaves each) per pixel, plus a sixth mesh for an edge-multiply
 * tint. Six draw calls and ~15 noise-octave evaluations per pixel per plane,
 * multiplied again by transparent overdraw where the planes stacked.
 *
 * Крок 11 Section A: one plane, five VIRTUAL slices composited inside a single
 * fragment shader, each slice's height faked by a UV parallax shift along the
 * view direction. Noise moved into a baked texture (getFogNoiseTexture — four
 * channels ARE four pre-computed octaves, so one texture2D fetch replaces an
 * octave loop; fbmTex/ridgedTex below are what read it, and that part survives
 * unchanged). Six draw calls became one.
 *
 * Крок 12 Section C2: A BOX, RAYMARCHED. The Крок 11 shape was the problem: a
 * flat plane, however cleverly shaded, has no vertical extent, so the fog could
 * never stand up off the board — repeatedly reported as "no volume". The fog is
 * now a real 8+overhang x FOG_SLAB_HEIGHT x 8+overhang slab whose fragment shader
 * intersects the view ray analytically and marches FOG_MARCH_STEPS samples
 * through a 3D density field. Still one draw call. See lib/fog.js for the full
 * account, including the two intermediate density models (a filled region under a
 * lumpy "ceiling" surface) that both read as a solid object and were abandoned.
 *
 * WHAT MUST NOT REGRESS, across any future rework of this file:
 *
 * The occlusion guarantee is computed from the MASK ALONE, never from the march —
 * see baseAlpha in main(). It is the same expression Крок 10 Section A tuned and
 * verified, evaluated at the texel-snapped cell the view ray's base-plane
 * crossing lands in, and the volume can only ever RAISE the final alpha via
 * max(). So "you cannot tell a light tile from a dark one under deep fog" cannot
 * be broken by anything the raymarch does. tools/fogdiag.mjs measures it directly
 * by repainting every tile flat and re-rendering: whatever the fog hides cannot
 * change between the two frames, so the per-square difference IS the leak.
 * Current: 2.18 luma mean, 4.44 max, against a 6-luma budget.
 *
 * baseAlpha is additionally gated by `onBoard`, which is not cosmetic — without
 * it the clamped ground UV gives every fragment in the overhang some border
 * square's full 94% opacity, painting a hard rectangular apron around the board.
 */

/*
 * Крок 14: pieces are opaque geometry standing INSIDE the fog volume, and
 * this shader was blind to them. Both `tGround` (the occlusion guarantee's
 * own square lookup) and the raymarch itself were computed by extending the
 * camera ray all the way to the slab's base plane, as if nothing solid were
 * in the way — correct for empty air, wrong the instant a piece's body
 * sits between the camera and that base-plane point.
 *
 * Concretely: for a camera ray through a point partway up a piece (any
 * height below the slab's own top, FOG_HEIGHT + FOG_SLAB_HEIGHT — which is
 * most of every piece's body, since only the tips of king/queen/bishop poke
 * above it), continuing that same ray on to the base plane travels well
 * PAST the piece — often landing on a square a full rank or more beyond it
 * (the exact distance grows with piece height and shrinks with camera
 * pitch; a straight-line calc for a resting-camera view of a king put it a
 * full rank away, e2 instead of e1). If that farther square is fogged, the
 * shader painted fog across the piece itself, even though the piece's own
 * square was never fogged — reported as "fog jumps in front of and covers a
 * piece," this time for a piece just standing still, not just Крок 13's
 * moving-piece case (squaresBetween in lib/fog.js), which this supersedes
 * for the general case: that fix only ever exempted squares along one
 * piece's own straight-line move, and did nothing for every other piece
 * sitting on the board, nor for a diagonal parallax drift that doesn't
 * follow the move's own line.
 *
 * The fix is a small, cheap scene-depth prepass (`useSceneDepth` below),
 * the same technique — and, on this exact codebase, the same COST class —
 * ContactShadows already pays every frame for its own depth pass. The fog
 * mesh hides itself for that one render (see `meshRef`/`visible` in the
 * component) so it isn't shading itself into its own occlusion input, and
 * isn't costing its own march twice over.
 *
 * The shader reconstructs the world position of whatever opaque surface the
 * depth texture recorded at this pixel (`worldPosFromDepth`) and turns it
 * into `dOpaque` — a distance along the SAME ray `t` already parameterises,
 * because `rd` is unit length and `t` is already Euclidean distance from
 * `cameraPosition`, so the two are directly comparable with no unit
 * conversion. Both the ground-hit search and the march's own upper bound
 * are then clamped to `dOpaque`:
 *
 * - If nothing opaque is nearer than the base plane, `dOpaque` is huge and
 *   every existing computation is untouched.
 * - If a piece IS nearer, the ground hit collapses onto the piece's own
 *   surface point instead of overshooting past it — `boardUv` of that point
 *   resolves to the square the piece is actually standing on, which is
 *   always either White's own (always visible) or a currently-visible enemy
 *   piece, so `baseAlpha` there is correctly ~0 by construction rather than
 *   by coincidence.
 * - The march's own far bound is clamped the same way, so cloud samples
 *   that would have landed behind the piece (from the camera's point of
 *   view) never get composited in front of it either — the volumetric term
 *   had the identical blind spot and needed the identical fix.
 *
 * This does NOT touch the occlusion-guarantee invariant above: it can only
 * ever make baseAlpha/volAlpha smaller at a pixel where fog previously
 * over-painted an opaque piece, never larger over a genuinely empty fogged
 * square (dOpaque there sits at the far clip plane, clamping nothing).
 */

/*
 * The box is axis-aligned in world space and never rotated or scaled, so the
