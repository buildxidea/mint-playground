// GameCanvas.jsx's `themeKey` state) needs every themed module to react to a
// changing theme instead of freezing it at import time, so PieceModel now
// takes `themeKey` as a prop and this only supplies the very first render's
// value for callers that don't pass one (DevPieceRow.jsx's dev-only usage).

/*
 * Deliberately darker and warmer than the #EDE7D9 background. When bone and
 * backdrop share a value the white pieces dissolve into the scene.
 *
 * Крок 13: was MeshStandardMaterial at roughness 0.78 / metalness 0 — the
 * only piece material with nothing worth reflecting. Lowering roughness alone
 * (tried first, down to 0.34) barely reads: a specular highlight is only
 * visually loud where it contrasts against a dark diffuse base, which is most
 * of why LACQUER (near-black, 0.32 roughness) looks "finished" next to a
 * light bone base at any roughness — the highlight is there but it blends
 * into the already-light colour underneath it instead of popping.
 *
 * Switched to MeshPhysicalMaterial for a thin clearcoat layer instead of
 * relying on the base layer's own specular. A clearcoat is a second,
 * independent Fresnel reflection sitting on top of the diffuse/roughness
 * response — it reads as a polished-ivory skin (a tight, bright highlight
 * that moves with the camera) regardless of how light the material under it
 * is, which is exactly the "finished, not raw" quality LACQUER already has
 * for a different (dark, glossier) reason. `roughness` stays fairly high
 * (0.58) so the BODY of the material still reads as matte bone/stone, not
 * plastic; `clearcoatRoughness` is much lower (0.08) so the coat itself
 * stays a tight, crisp highlight instead of a second soft sheen. `metalness`
 * stays at 0 — bone is a dielectric, not a metal, and clearcoat is what's
 * doing the work now.
 *
 * flatShading stays TRUE — also tried false (smooth shading via the model's
 * own imported normals) on the theory that BONE's visible facet edges read as
 * "unfinished" more than LACQUER's do. Screenshot proved the opposite: the
 * decimated mesh is exactly as non-manifold as "Asset budget" in CLAUDE.md
 * documents (the knight alone has 38,146 disconnected components), so its
 * imported normals are not consistent enough for smooth shading — every
 * piece came out mottled with dark blotches, worse than flat. Keep
 * flatShading true for both materials; it isn't the source of the
 * raw-vs-finished gap.
