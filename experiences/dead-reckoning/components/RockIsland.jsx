 * Крок 12, Section D: the rock wears Mint's own baked textures.
 *
 * Крок 11, Section C replaced Mint's material with a procedural granite grey
 * plus a *geometric* foliage guess — "green where radius > 0.6..0.8 * maxRadius
 * AND height > 0.5..0.65". That guess was wrong in the most visible way
 * possible: the basin's raised rim is, by construction, both high and at large
 * radius, so the mask fired across the entire rim and the whole formation
 * rendered as one flat green bowl. The stone gradient underneath it was never
 * visible at all.
 *
 * There was never a need to guess. Reading the .glb's own JSON chunk shows the
 * material carries three baked textures Mint painted and the old code threw
 * away:
 *
 *   baseColorTexture         (webp, via EXT_texture_webp) - grey granite,
 *                            GREEN foliage on the pine canopies, BROWN bark on
 *                            the trunks. Exactly the "листя зеленим, стовбур
 *                            коричневим" the brief asks for, already authored.
 *   normalTexture            (jpeg) - the surface detail
 *   metallicRoughnessTexture (webp)
 *
 * So this now keeps the loaded material's maps and only overrides the
 * *response* (roughness/metalness/side). The brief's fallback — "якщо не бачиш
 * контурів, тоді просто закрась все в сірий" — is not needed, because the
 * contours are in the texture rather than in the geometry.
 *
 * Two consequences worth knowing:
 * - flatShading must be OFF. It was on to make the untextured grey read as
 *   faceted stone; with a real normal map it fights the map and destroys the
 *   baked detail.
 * - `side` is forced to FrontSide. Mint marks the material doubleSided, which
 *   for a closed rock means every covered pixel is shaded twice for no visual
 *   difference — and this is the largest object on screen by area.

 * Крок 16, Section C: the island rendered fully black on Ocean specifically

 *
 * Ocean's "Basalt Kelp Ledge" texture is authentically dark basalt — that's
 * correct art direction, not a bug in the asset. The bug is downstream:
 * MeshStandardMaterial's `color` only ever MULTIPLIES the sampled texture
 * (max effective factor is white, i.e. no darkening at all), so no tint,
 * however light, can lift a 15/255-mean texture into a visibly blue-green
 * rock. It can only push it further toward literal (0,0,0), which is what
 * "the island is solid black" actually was — confirmed by forcing
 * `material.side = DoubleSide` live (ruling out a backface/winding issue,
 * which would have shown SOMETHING lit) and finding the fix made no visual
 * difference at all.
 *
 * The fix is a themed, additive EMISSIVE floor — not a brighter multiply,
 * which doesn't exist. Emissive stacks on top of the diffuse/specular
 * response instead of replacing it, so the baked texture's own contours
 * (Крок 12 Section D's whole point — "the contours are in the texture, not
 * the geometry") still read as relative light/dark variation above the
 * floor; only the absolute minimum ever gets lifted. Sized per-theme from

 * THE FIT. Measured with tools/measure-rock.mjs (kept in the repo — re-run it

 * 128x128 top-surface heightfield rather than binning vertices or trusting a
 * Box3. Two things that method establishes and the previous derivation got
 * wrong:
 *
 * 1. The basin floor is at local Y = 0.417 and covers 68% of the top surface —
 *    that part was right.
 * 2. The old code fitted a *radius*: it put the floor's "flat radius" (0.65) at
 *    BOARD_HALF_WIDTH * 1.1. But the board is a SQUARE, and a square of
 *    half-width s reaches s*sqrt(2) at its corners. Fitting the half-width to a
 *    radius leaves the four corners hanging over whatever lies between s and
 *    1.414*s — which is where the rim is. That is the reported symptom: the
 *    corners did not sit evenly in the basin.
 *
 * The table that actually answers it, counting cells whose top surface pokes
 * more than 0.01 above the floor inside a square footprint of half-width s:

 *   0.675     0.718         1125
 *
 * At the old effective s of 0.591 roughly 380 cells of rock stood above the
 * basin floor inside the board's own footprint, up to 0.052 local units — which
 * at the old scale is 0.38 world units, more than the board slab's 0.30
 * thickness, so rock genuinely pushed up past the playing surface at the edges.
 *
 * ROCK_FIT_HALF_WIDTH is therefore 0.46, just inside the last clean value, and
