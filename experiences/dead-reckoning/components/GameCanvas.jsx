 * 16.3 degrees below horizontal — that number only falls out of this formula
 * (pitch-below-horizontal = 90 - polarAngle) with this sign convention.
 *
 * MIN_POLAR_ANGLE's whole history (0.838 rad -> 0.38 rad, see git blame on

 * continuous horizon from showing its own edge. Крок 9.6, Section C removed
 * that horizon entirely — the board now sits on a small floating rock with
 * open sky underneath it on purpose (see RockIsland.jsx) — so there is no
 * ground-gap bulge left to clamp around at any angle. 0.38 rad (~22 degrees)
 * is kept because it's still what the cinematic intro's low opening shot and
 * the brief's own ask for this value need, not because anything would break
 * at a smaller one now.
 *
 * MAX_POLAR_ANGLE = 1.25 rad (72 degrees) keeps the camera from dipping low
 * enough to look up through the board's underside / the pedestal's own
 * backface — that constraint is about the board and pedestal specifically,

 * Крок 12, Section B: NO FOG ON THE INTRO.

 * empty set so everything read as fogged, frame 1 with only g8 clear so the
 * black knight sat alone at the frontier, frame 2 with the live starting
 * visibility. Reusing the real mechanic instead of mocking one is still the
 * right architecture and is not what changed here.
 *
 * What changed is the brief: the loading/intro screen should not be under fog
 * at all. It is the first thing anyone sees, and three shots of a near-uniform
 * grey sheet is a bad first frame — it hides the board, the pieces, and the
 * rock the whole composition is built on.
 *
 * So during 'intro' and 'transitioning' the fog mesh is not mounted at all (see
 * the Canvas children below) and visibility is FULL. Both halves of that matter:
 * dropping the fog alone would leave `Pieces`' own rule ("an enemy piece outside
 * `visibility` is not rendered") in force, so Black's whole side would simply be
 * missing from the intro — an empty half-board with nothing covering it, which
 * reads worse than the fog did. ALL_VISIBLE makes the intro show the complete
 * set on a clear board.
 *
 * The real fog is still the first thing the player sees *of the mechanic*: it
 * appears as gameplay starts, which is also when the HUD and controls arrive.
