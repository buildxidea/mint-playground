/*
 * Крок 14: a captured king is checked FIRST, before any of chess.js's own
 * status methods. Those assume `_kings[color]` is a valid square — once a
 * king is actually gone from the board (only reachable via the king's-own-
 * capture bypass in lib/kingCapture.js; normal play never produces this
 * state), isCheckmate()/isCheck() stay well-behaved (verified directly: they
 * return false, not throw) but isDraw() reports true for the wrong reason
 * (insufficient material once one side has nothing left) — a real answer to
 * a different question. Checking the missing king first means that quirk
 * never has a chance to surface.
 *
 * hasKingCaptureEscape/canCaptureEnemyKing guard the checkmate/draw calls
 * themselves: chess.js computes both from its own legal-move list and its
 * own material count, neither of which knows this rule exists.
 *
 * - hasKingCaptureEscape: a position that's checkmate/stalemate
 *   *specifically because* the only way out was capturing a defended
 *   checking piece would otherwise end the game one move before the
 *   ability meant to save it ever gets used — exactly backwards from the
 *   point of this feature.
 * - canCaptureEnemyKing: once a king's own capture leaves it standing next
 *   to the enemy king (only reachable through this rule), chess.js's
 *   isDraw() sees two lone kings and calls it an insufficient-material
 *   draw — correct for a position that could truly never resolve, wrong
 *   here, since the very next move can simply end the game by taking the
 *   exposed king. Verified this actually fires in the browser, not just in
 *   theory: capturing a defended rook down to a bare king vs king reported
 *   'draw' on the very next status computation, before black ever got the
 *   chance to take the exposed white king.
 *
 * Both fall through to 'check'/'playing', already-existing states that
 * correctly mean "still playing."
