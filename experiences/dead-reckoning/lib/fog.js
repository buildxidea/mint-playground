 * tile — measured -54/-28 luma at the time — but visible is not the same as
 * blind. Multiply blending can only ever scale what's underneath; it cannot
 * reach true opacity, so even the deepest fog still let a player tell light
 * tiles from dark ones by eye. In fog of war, deep fog has to be a wall:
 * looking at a square 3+ ranks away, a player should not be able to tell its
 * colour at all.
 *
 * The fix drops multiply blending as the *primary* mechanism entirely and
 * goes back to plain alpha — but this time actually reaching near-total
 * opacity in the deep field (FOG_MAX_ALPHA = 0.94) instead of stopping at
 * FOG_OPACITY's old 0.85 with a colour too pale to matter. At 0.94 alpha,

 * pixel — that 6% ceiling is where the "< 6 luma difference" verification
 * criterion actually comes from, not a number picked to sound precise.

 * this low means most of the fogged field is already at full opacity, not

 * Крок 12, Section C: THE FOG HAD NO VOLUME BECAUSE IT HAD NO VARIATION AT ALL.
 *
 * Not "too little" — none. Trace the old maths for a settled, fully fogged cell,
 * which is the majority of the fogged field:
 *
 *   ownVisible = 0.0                       (exactly; only mid-wave is it partial)
 *   density    = pow(1 - 0, 1.35) = 1.0
 *   alpha      = smoothstep(0, 0.38, 1.0) * 0.94 = 0.94        <- constant
 *   colorVariance = 1 - smoothstep(0.38, 1.0, 1.0) = 0
 *   color      = mix(uColorMid, noisyColor, 0) = uColorMid     <- constant
 *
 * Both channels are constants. The three noise fields (mass/wisps/detail) were
 * computed per pixel on five slices and then multiplied by zero. The deep field
 * was a flat #C4C8C7 fill, which is exactly what it looked like. This is the
 * same saturated-density trap Крок 11 Section D found and fixed for the
 * *boundary position* — it was never fixed for the fog's appearance.
 *
 * The fix separates the two jobs the old single `density` was doing:
 *
 *   OCCLUSION stays keyed off the mask alone. The base slice still reaches
 *   FOG_MAX_ALPHA over any fogged cell, so the fog-of-war guarantee ("you
 *   cannot tell a light tile from a dark one under deep fog") is untouched —
 *   it was always alpha's job, never colour's.
 *
 *   APPEARANCE becomes a function of the noise field again, through two cues
 *   that actually read as volume rather than as a grey card:
 *
 *   1. Self-shading. Sampling the cloud field one short step TOWARD the light
 *      and comparing gives a directional derivative: where the fog is denser
 *      between here and the light, this pixel sits in the shadow of its own
 *      billow. That single extra sample per slice is what turns a flat field
 *      into rounded, lit forms. FOG_SHADE_GAIN scales it, FOG_LIGHT_UV is the
 *      direction, FOG_LIGHT_STEP how far.
 *   2. A vertical lift. Real cloud reads as volume mostly because its top is
 *      bright and its underside is dark. FOG_HEIGHT_LIFT brightens each slice
 *      toward FOG_LIT_COLOR in proportion to its height in the stack, so the
 *      base slice is the shadowed underside and the top slice catches the sky.
 *
 * FOG_LIGHT_UV is derived, not chosen: Lighting.jsx's key light sits at world
 * [4, 6, 3] aimed at the origin. The fog plane maps world x = -4 + 8u and
 * world z = 4 - 8v, so +x is +u and +z is -v; the horizontal direction toward
 * the light is therefore normalize(vec2(+4, -3)) = (0.8, -0.6). If the key light
 * ever moves, this moves with it or the fog will be lit from the wrong side.
 *
 * FOG_BODY_KNEE is the other half of "volume": on the RAISED slices, alpha is
 * now noise-driven rather than flat, so a slice only exists where the cloud
 * field is strong enough. The stack's silhouette billows instead of being five
 * stacked slabs of identical outline. The base slice deliberately does NOT get
 * this — it is the one carrying occlusion.

 * NOISE SAMPLING SCALES — and why none of them is a round number.
 *
 * These were 3.0 / 4.0 / 11.0 with a 3.2 vertical stretch. Round numbers, and on
 * an 8x8 board sampled through a noise texture whose lattice periods are powers
 * of two (4/8/16/32, see getFogNoiseTexture), that is a resonance waiting to
 * happen. It did:
 *
 *   mass sampled at vUv * 3.0 => 3 texture tiles x 4 lattice cells = 12 cells
 *   across 8 board squares = 1.5 lattice cells per square. A 1.5-cell period
 *   repeats exactly every TWO squares — which is precisely the checkerboard's
 *   own period.
 *
 * So the fog's brightness locked to square parity. Measured with
 * tools/fogdiag.mjs before the fix: over 40 fully fogged squares, the mean luma
 * of fog above light squares was 19.1 higher than above dark squares. That is
 * not a tile leak — `accum.a` was verified at 0.94-0.96, so at most ~5% of the
 * tile can show through, worth about 1.9 luma — it was the fog's own noise
 * drawing a grid aligned to the board.
 *
 * lib/noise.js already documents this exact class of bug for the same reason
 * ("an integer lacunarity lines every octave up on the same lattice and leaves a
 * visible grid"); these are the same fix applied one level up. The values are
 * chosen to be mutually non-harmonic and to give a non-terminating cells-per-
 * square ratio, so no short spatial period can align with the 8x8 grid.
 *
 * FOG_LIGHT_STEP is the self-shading sample's offset, in UV. It is deliberately
 * small: multiplied by FOG_NOISE_SCALE_MASS it lands about a fifth of a lattice
 * cell away, so `mass - massToLight` is a genuine local gradient. At the 0.05 it
 * started at, the step was 0.6 of a lattice cell — far enough that the two
 * samples were effectively independent noise, which produces sparkle rather than

/*
 * Крок 12, Section C2: THE FOG IS A VOLUME NOW, NOT A PAINTED PLANE.
 *
 * Section C above fixed the fog's *colour* being a literal constant, and the
 * result did show structure — but it read as mottled stone, not as fog, and the
 * reason is structural rather than a tuning miss:
 *
 *   Every one of FOG_LAYERS "slices" was composited into ONE flat plane lying on
 *   the board. Крок 11 Section A had replaced five real planes at five heights
 *   with a single plane whose slices fake their height through a UV parallax
 *   shift. That bought a big draw-call win and it kept the top-down read
 *   identical — but a shape painted inside a flat 8x8 rectangle cannot stand up
 *   out of it. No amount of colour work inside that rectangle produces volume,
 *   because there is no vertical extent anywhere in the model. Which is exactly
 *   the reported symptom, twice.
 *
 * So the fog gets geometry: a box 8 x FOG_SLAB_HEIGHT x 8 sitting on the board,
 * raymarched in its fragment shader. Per pixel the shader intersects the view ray
 * with the box analytically, walks FOG_MARCH_STEPS samples through the interior,
 * and accumulates density with Beer-Lambert extinction. That gives, for free and
 * correctly rather than as an approximation:
 *
 *   - a real silhouette: fog banks visibly rise above the board and occlude
 *     along the line of sight, instead of being clipped to the board rectangle
 *   - real parallax as the camera orbits, from real geometry
 *   - genuine depth accumulation: a long grazing path through the slab is denser
 *     than a short overhead one, which is what "thick" actually means
 *
 * The occlusion guarantee is NOT left to the raymarch. FogShader keeps computing
 * the old mask-driven alpha at the point where the view ray crosses the slab's
 * base plane, and the final alpha is the max of that and the volume's own. So
 * "deep fog hides the tile underneath" is still carried by the same expression
 * Крок 10 Section A tuned and verified, and the raymarch can only ever add
 * silhouette on top of it — it cannot subtract occlusion. See FogShader.jsx.
 *
 * FOG_SLAB_HEIGHT is 1.1 world units — a bit over one board square.
 *
 * It started at 0.55 and that was measurably too thin. Combined with the density
 * falloff below, essentially all of the fog sat in the bottom fifth of the slab,
 * so from a shallow camera (where volume should be most obvious, since you are
 * looking THROUGH the bank rather than down onto it) the fog presented as a flat
 * tilted sheet of frosted glass. There has to be enough vertical room for the
 * billows to actually differ in height before any of the shading work can read.
 *
 * The ceiling on this value is the camera: the shader uses a FrontSide box, so
 * the camera must stay outside the slab or the near faces get culled and the fog
 * vanishes. The shallowest legal camera (MAX_POLAR_ANGLE 1.25 rad at CameraRig's
 * resting distance) sits at y = 11.55 * cos(72 deg) = 3.57; the slab tops out at
 * FOG_HEIGHT + this = 1.12. Comfortable, but do not raise this past ~3 without
 * switching the material to DoubleSide.
 *
 * Note the tallest piece (the king, 1.45) now stands through the slab. That is
 * fine and needs no special handling: a square holding one of your own pieces is
 * always visible so its column carries no fog, and enemy pieces inside fog are
 * not rendered at all. Where a piece does overlap, the depth test does the right
 * thing — the fog is depthWrite:false but still depth-TESTED.
 *
 * FOG_MARCH_STEPS 12 is the cost knob, and it replaces FOG_LAYERS as the first
 * perf lever: a straight linear trade against fragment cost. Per pixel it is ~12
 * mask fetches plus ~12-24 noise fetches, against the ~24 the five-slice version
 * used, and it is still one draw call.

 * DENSITY SHAPE — and a modelling dead end worth not repeating.
 *
 * The first two raymarch attempts defined a fog SURFACE and filled everything
 * below it: ceiling = base + cloud * billow, then density = 1 below that height
 * and 0 above, with a soft skin across it. Both read as a solid object — first as
 * a slab of ice (base 0.30, narrow skin: a flat lid plus a hard vertical wall at
 * the frontier), then, after widening the skin and dropping the base to 0.10, as
 * a translucent plate hovering over the board with its bounding box plainly
 * visible.
 *
 * The reason is structural, not tuning. "Filled below a surface" is a model of a
 * SOLID with a lumpy top. Widening the skin to hide the lid just smears partial
 * density through the whole slab, which is worse: a uniform block of haze whose
 * silhouette is the bounding box itself. There is no setting of base/billow/skin
 * that turns that model into fog.
 *
 * Fog is a density field with no surface at all. So:
 *
 *   vertical = pow(1 - h, FOG_VERTICAL_FALLOFF)   dense on the board, thinning up
 *   shape    = cloud * vertical
 *   d        = smoothstep(KNEE, KNEE + SOFT, shape)
 *
 * The threshold is what matters: subtracting a floor from a field that is already
 * decaying with height means only the strongest cloud values survive high up, so
 * the fog resolves into separate billows that taper off and end at different
 * heights in different places — and reaches exactly zero before the slab top, so
 * there is no top edge to see. Gaps between billows are real holes, not thin
 * spots, which is what lets the shape read against the sky.
 */

/*
 * Крок 13: squares a piece's own move animation physically flies over.
 *
 * Bug: an own piece sliding across several ranks/files (Pieces.jsx animates a
 * straight lerp from its old square to its new one, arcing up to
 * MOVE_ARC_HEIGHT at the midpoint) is rendered every frame regardless of fog —
 * "a square holding your own piece is never fogged" — but that rule is only
 * ever applied to the piece's RESTING square. Mid-flight it also passes over
 * whatever squares sit between old and new, and those can be genuinely
 * fogged (outside `visibility`, no piece of yours currently attacks or
 * occupies them). FogShader has no idea a piece is passing overhead — it
 * marches real volumetric density there — and since the fog box's own
 * surface is geometrically nearer the overhead camera than a piece flying
 * below the slab top, the fog fragment isn't discarded and paints straight
 * over the piece for that instant. Reported as "fog jumps in front of and
 * covers a piece."
 *
 * The fix (GameCanvas.jsx) temporarily unions these squares into the Set fed
 * to <Fog> — never into the Set fed to <Pieces>, which stays strictly
 * game-accurate — for the duration of the flight, so the fog simply doesn't
 * exist over the piece's flight path while it's in the air. Only a straight
 * rank/file/diagonal path is well-defined (rook/bishop/queen/king/pawn
 * slides); a knight's hop isn't collinear, so this returns just its two
 * endpoints and accepts the brief in-air flicker as a knight-specific edge
 * case not worth a curved-path special case for a ~0.35s animation.
