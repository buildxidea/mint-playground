     * because it is still the best-measured placement this capture has ever
     * had; re-enabling is `mode: 'image'` -> `'splat'` on this one field.
     *
     * Крок 22: the placement is solved rather than swept, against an
     * importance-pruned asset (see CLAUDE.md's Крок 22 for the full account).
     *
     * The scale/position/rotation below all come out of one derivation. This
     * capture is a panorama shot from INSIDE — local radius ~116 with no open
     * interior (nearest splat 0.1..1.5 local at every candidate clearing
     * centre), which is why every previous attempt to sit the camera in it
     * reported "buried in a hillside", and why placing it as an external body
     * is the only option left. So:
     *
     *   - rotY -196.6 swings the capture's own densest region (body centroid
     *     local [10, 35, -98], azimuth 174.2 deg) round to the direction the
     *     resting camera looks, which is the painted main segment's own
     *     azimuth (Backdrop.jsx: HOME_AZIMUTH - PI = -22.4 deg).
     *   - position is 60 world units out along that same azimuth, sunk so the
     *     capture's ridge tops (local y ~ +60) land 19 deg below horizontal as
     *     seen from the resting camera at y=7 — i.e. inside the band the
     *     resting camera actually frames, the same derivation Backdrop.jsx's
     *     own TOP_Y uses for the painting. A placement that misses that band
     *     is INVISIBLE at rest while still scoring well on a shallow-biased
     *     orbit scan; that trap cost a candidate this pass (rest coverage
     *     0.000 at posY 0).
     *   - scale 0.42 sets the range's own height to 45% of its distance.
     *     Appearance is invariant under a rigid scale-and-push (only s/D
     *     matters), so this pair is one point on a line; a farther, larger
     *     twin looks identical.
     *
     * Measured against snow's shipped placement (tools/place-splat.mjs, same
     * settings): rest-view frame coverage 0.410 vs snow's 0.418, fragments per
     * frame 2.7M vs snow's 5.5M, nearest in-frame splat 45.5 vs 35.6. Mist's
     * own old s3 transform above measured 31.6M fragments — 12x this — which
     * is the Ocean cost profile a real device already rejected at 20fps.
     * Coverage 180 deg away is exactly 0, so the painted segments still carry
     * the rest of the orbit.

    // around the board's own origin, putting the camera INSIDE it: ~880
    // fragment evaluations per pixel, CLAUDE.md's Крок 21), so it is the last
    // of the three anyone should reach for if splats are ever revisited.
    /*
     * Крок 24: ON — and the "last of the three anyone should reach for" note
     * above is answered rather than ignored. What made this capture the worst
     * of the three was never the asset, it was that one transform: scale 12
     * about the board's own origin puts the camera INSIDE the cloud. That is
     * fixed here, by the same derivation Крок 22 used for mist, so the reason
     * to rank it last no longer holds.
     *
     * The asset is unchanged from Крок 21 — importance-ranked, no --declutter,
     * 60,000 splats. A side-by-side splat-lab A/B against the full 1.92M cloud
     * found it near-indistinguishable at that count, which is what licenses
     * enabling it; --declutter stays OFF for this capture on that evidence.
     *
     * The placement is derived, not swept:
     *
     *   - rotation is Y-only. tools/probe-splat-axes.mjs re-confirms this
     *     capture is already Y-up (p01-p99 spread 14.89 on Y vs 27.58/27.71 on
     *     X/Z), so snow's rotX -90 correction stays off it — copying that onto
     *     an already-Y-up capture is exactly the bug Крок 20 records. rotY 135
     *     is chosen by measurement, not by eye: of the eight rotations scored
     *     it gives the highest rest-view coverage (0.440) at essentially the
     *     best nearest-splat distance, with zero coverage 180 deg away.
     *   - position is 60 world units out along the painted main segment's own
     *     azimuth (Backdrop.jsx: HOME_AZIMUTH - PI = -22.4 deg), sunk so the
     *     body's own p01..p99 height lands in the band between 21 and 38 deg
     *     below horizontal as seen from the resting camera at y=7 — the same
     *     visible-band derivation Backdrop.jsx's TOP_Y uses for the painting.
     *     Крок 22's trap applies here too and was avoided the same way: the
     *     candidates were scored against the RESTING camera explicitly, not
     *     just tools/place-splat.mjs's shallow-biased ring, because a
     *     placement can score well on that ring and sit entirely above the
     *     resting frame.
     *   - scale falls out of that band fit. Appearance is invariant under a
     *     rigid scale-and-push (only s/D matters) — confirmed here, D=45/60/75
     *     scored identical coverage and detail — so this is one point on a line.
     *
     * One derivation detail worth not re-deriving: the band must be fitted to
     * the body's UNWEIGHTED positional p01..p99 (height 14.89). Fitting it to
     * an importance-weighted extent instead reports height 51 and collapses
     * the island to 2% frame coverage, because importance ranking favours this
     * capture's detached-clutter tail (those splats are large and opaque —
     * the same property that makes --declutter matter for snow).
     *
     * Measured (CPU raster, 320x200, unoccluded) against the two placements

     * costs about what mist costs, and sits farther from the camera than
     * either — against an old transform measured at four orders of magnitude
     * more fragment work. Coverage 180 deg away is exactly 0, so the painted
     * segments still carry the rest of the orbit unaided; the painting renders
     * underneath regardless (Backdrop.jsx's usesPainting is true whenever
     * `image` is set and mode is not 'procedural'), so this is a horizon band
     * layered on a proven-fast floor, never a replacement for it.
     *
     * Real fps/VRAM is unmeasured here as always (CLAUDE.md's "Headless
     * browser"). `?debug=1`'s FpsCounter on real hardware is the check;
     * `?spstddev=` / `?spkeep=` tune it without a rebuild, and `mode` back to
     * 'image' is the one-line revert onto a floor already proven fast.
     *
     * Крок 25: reverted to 'image', taking that one-line revert. Real-device
     * testing of this exact placement (165fps per the on-screen counter, but
     * 95% GPU and visible stutter) is the reason — see CLAUDE.md's Крок 25 for
     * the fuller account, including why the FPS counter and the actual
     * experience disagreed here. Everything above is kept because the
     * horizon-band placement itself is correctly derived and cheap (33
     * frag/px) — this revert is about the LATER enclosing-placement
     * experiments (also in CLAUDE.md), not about undoing this placement.
     * `splatUrl`/`splat` stay wired so `mode: 'image' -> 'splat'` is still a
     * one-line re-enable, same convention as mist/snow.

     * The transform below is solved, not swept by eye: the capture body's own
     * centroid is put at world [4, -32, 60], which is the elevation band the
     * resting camera actually frames (it pitches 37.3 degrees down, so the
     * visible band at that distance is world y -10.5 .. -25.3 — the same
     * derivation the painted backdrop's own TOP_Y uses, see Backdrop.jsx), and
     * scaled so the body reads as a distant massif rather than a wall the
     * camera stands inside. Measured against the old transform: nearest splat
     * 2.1 -> 32.0, fragments per frame 151M -> 5.4M (28x less overdraw).
     *
     * rotX -90 is KEPT and is independently confirmed correct — this capture
     * really is Z-up (tools/probe-splat-axes.mjs: p01-p99 spread 86.6 on Z vs
     * 104.1 / 118.5 on Y / X), unlike mist's, whose own comment records that
     * copying this correction was the bug rather than the fix.
